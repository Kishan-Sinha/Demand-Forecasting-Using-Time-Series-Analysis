# Demand-Forecasting-Using-Time-Series-Analysis

Time Series Forecasting of Tractor Sales: A comparative analysis and model recommendation using SARIMAX and Exponential Smoothing. It's main components are:

**1. Data preparation, modeling and evaluation:** This Jupyter Notebook details the complete time series forecasting workflow for tractor sales. It covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) including **visualization of sales trends**, stationarity checks (rolling statistics, seasonal decomposition, ACF/PACF plots), and the implementation of two key forecasting models: SARIMAX and Exponential Smoothing. The notebook concludes with the in-sample prediction and evaluation of these models using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE

**2. Evaluation Summary:** It includes a table summarizing key performance metrics for both models. Based on this quantitative analysis, a clear recommendation for the optimal forecasting model is provided, along with a justification of the choice 

**3. Tractor Sales.csv:** The original Raw file on which the Whole analysis was carried on. It contains a structured sales record of tractors from an US based manufacturer
